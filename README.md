- **Customisable**: Exclude specific folders or directories from the report as needed.
- **Optimised Performance**: Designed to run efficiently, even on systems with large amounts of data.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be scheduled using Synology's Task Scheduler for automated reporting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Tested on a Synology NAS running DSM version 7.2.2.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.
- User account with sufficient permissions to execute scripts and access shared folders.
- Set up Synology Email notifications from the DSM Control Panel -> Notification -> Email -> Sender.

### Installation

1. **Create a Dedicated Scripts Folder**

   It is recommended to have a dedicated shared folder for scripts, for example, `Scripts`.

2. **Copy the Script to the Shared Folder**

   Copy one of the `.sh` files (depending on your requirementsâ€”the single or multiple version) to the shared folder you created.

3. **Create a Scheduled Task in DSM**

   - Navigate to DSM **Control Panel** -> **Task Scheduler**.
   - Click on **Create** and select **Scheduled Task** > **User-defined script**.

4. **Configure the Task**

   - **General Settings**:
     - **Task Name**: `shared_folder_usage_report`
     - **User**: Select `root` from the dropdown menu.

   - **Schedule Settings**:
     - Set the task to run **Monthly**.
     - In the **Run on the following days** section, select **Last** and ensure all days are ticked. This will schedule the script to run at the end of each month, regardless of the specific day.

   - **Task Settings**:
     - **User-defined script**:
       ```bash
       bash /volume1/Scripts/shared_folder_usage_report.sh
       ```
       *(Adjust the path to the script if necessary.)*

   - **Notification Settings**:
     - Under **Notification**, tick **Send run details by email**.
     - Enter your email address to receive the report via email.

5. **Test the Script Manually**

   - Before relying on the scheduled task, it's advisable to test the script manually.
   - Open **Terminal** or **SSH** into your Synology NAS.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     bash /volume1/Scripts/shared_folder_usage_report.sh
     ```
     *(Adjust the path if necessary.)*
   - Verify that the output meets your expectations.

6. **Finalise the Scheduled Task**

   - If the manual test is successful, your scheduled task is set up correctly.
   - The script will now run automatically at the end of each month and send the report to your email.

By following these steps, you'll have the **Synology Shared Folders Usage Report** script up and running, providing you with valuable insights into your NAS storage utilisation.
